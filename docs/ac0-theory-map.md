# AC0 theory map

This document records the source correspondence and trust boundary for the
nonuniform constant-depth circuit development. It is a roadmap, not evidence
that unchecked milestones have been proved.

## Source convention

The quantitative endpoint follows Johan Hastad,
[*Computational Limitations for Small-Depth Circuits*](https://people.kth.se/~johanh/thesis.pdf)
(MIT Press, 1986), Chapter 5, Theorem 5.1, and the closely related STOC paper
[*Almost Optimal Lower Bounds for Small Depth Circuits*](https://doi.org/10.1145/12130.12132)
(1986).

The source model has arbitrary-fan-in AND and OR gates, negations only at input
literals, depth equal to the number of gate levels on a longest input-output
path, and size equal to the number of AND/OR gates. General negations can be
pushed to inputs with at most a factor-two size increase. The source theorem
rules out depth-`k` parity circuits of size
`2^((1/10)^(k-1) * n^(1/(k-1)))`

for `n > n0 ^ k`, for an absolute constant `n0`. The Lean development will use
an exact natural-number inequality underneath this real-exponent notation and
derive a source-facing corollary only after rounding has been proved.

The switching endpoint is the decision-tree form of Hastad's switching lemma,
stated explicitly in the introduction of
[*Criticality of AC0-Formulae*](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/182/):
for a width-`t` DNF under a `p`-random restriction, the probability that the
restricted function has decision-tree depth at least `s` is at most
`(5 * p * t)^s` (the complementary CNF statement follows by negation). Exact
probability and small-`p` side conditions will remain visible in the finite
theorem.

## Existing-library convention audit

- `Circuit sigma n g m` is a shared, topologically ordered DAG with `g`
  internal gates and free designated output wires.
- `Circuit.size` is exactly `g`.
- Inputs have depth zero; every internal operation, including a unary NOT if it
  is represented as a gate, adds one to depth.
- `InputSubstitution` already gives semantic substitution and single-variable
  fixing, while `DeMorgan.ProgramRestriction` performs basis-specific partial
  evaluation for the binary De Morgan basis.
- The Hastad model therefore needs its own arbitrary-fan-in basis and a
  negation-normal representation. Internal NOT gates cannot silently be made
  free or depthless in the generic circuit model.

## Claim labels

- **Literature theorem:** a statement matched to the cited source.
- **Formalization strengthening:** a proved compositional or exact finite form
  not asserted to be new mathematics.
- **Research candidate:** an unproved statement, excluded from public theorem
  dependencies.
- **Barrier:** a general proved obstruction to a proposed route.
- **Computational observation:** test evidence only; it cannot discharge a
  mathematical milestone.

## Validation record

The family milestone passed `lake build Algebraic AlgebraicTests --wfail`,
`lake test`, `lake lint`, and `git diff --check` on 2026-09-03. Its public
resource lemmas use no axioms or only Lean's standard `propext`,
`Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`; they do not use `sorryAx`, custom axioms,
or executable proof certificates.
